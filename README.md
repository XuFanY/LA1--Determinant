Math.h: some basic math functions, which may be useful.
Determinant.h: the class Determinant, includes its definition and body.
Aside from the functions that compute determinant, there are some other
functions. You can read it by yourself. (I have written some explanation,
though it is very easy)
main.cpp: the main function, that’s all.
Data: there are some specific determinant with its correct value and some
formula with derivation.
